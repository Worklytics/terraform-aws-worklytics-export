# terraform-aws-worklytics-export

A Terraform module to create infra to support exporting data from Worklytics to AWS.

Our intent is that this will be [published as a Terraform module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/modules/publish), so will follow [standard Terraform
module structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure).
